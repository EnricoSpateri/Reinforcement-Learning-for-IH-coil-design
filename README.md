# Reinforcement-Learning-for-IH-coil-design

1- Download FEMM from Official site
2- Download the GitHub repository
3- Put the content of the repository in the FEMM42->mfiles folder
4- Open Main.m
5- The Main is composed of different sections. The first section tests the FEMM, the 2nd creates the environment, the 3rd creates the network,
6- Download the matlab toolbox for reinforcement learning
7- Open the Reinforcement Learning Designer
8- Import the environment 
9- Create an agent
10- Import the Q-Value Critic - Critic and import the deterministic actor
11- Set the settings as in the paper
12- Set the save agents flag on
13- run
14- Run the last two sections of the main to define an arbitrary distribution and and get the best result
